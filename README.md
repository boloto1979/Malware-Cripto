 # Encryption Malware
This project is an example of cryptography malware, which encrypts all files in a directory (except the malware code itself and the encryption key) using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.

## Operation ##
The malware generates a random encryption key using Fernet.generate_key() and saves it in a "key.key" file. It then lists all the files in the current directory (except the malware code itself and the encryption key) and adds them to a list.

For each file in the list, the malware reads the file's contents, encrypts it using the previously generated encryption key, and then overwrites the original file with the encrypted contents..This project depends on the cryptography library, which can be installed using pip:

## Execution ##
This code must be executed in the directory where the files you want to encrypt are located. It is important to note that once files are encrypted, they cannot be decrypted without the original encryption key.

## Dependencies ##
This project depends on the cryptography library, which can be installed using pip:

__pip install cryptography__
